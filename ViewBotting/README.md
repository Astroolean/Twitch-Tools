(right now the free proxies are detcted by twitch and get blocked however private proxies or even proxy chaining should fix that and also it uses your computers hardware so your limited to the amount of instances your computer can handle. The only way to properly do 1000+ at a time less or more whatever depends on your hardware. Purchasing a VPS is a good strategy if your going to be selling the views you can offer)

Key VPS (Virtual Private Server) Specifications Needed for 1000 Viewers:

RAM (Most Critical): Each headless Firefox instance, even optimized, will consume a few hundred MBs of RAM. For 1000 instances, you'd need at least 256GB to 512GB of RAM, possibly more. This is the biggest cost driver.

CPU (Very Important): You'd need a server with a high core count and good single-core performance. Something like 32 to 64 virtual CPU cores (or even more, depending on the specific CPU architecture).

Network Bandwidth: Streaming 1000 concurrent Twitch streams requires a massive amount of outbound bandwidth. You'd need a VPS with a guaranteed high-speed connection (e.g., 10 Gbps port) and potentially a high data transfer allowance (or unmetered bandwidth, which is rare for such high usage).

Storage: While not as critical as RAM or CPU, you'd still need sufficient SSD storage for the OS, Firefox installations, and temporary profiles (e.g., 200GB+ NVMe SSD).

Looking at $1500-$3000/month alone for the VPS that could handle 1000 viewers botted as an example and thats just the VPS... just a rough estimate could be more could be less that was the range I found.
Alongside that buy your own private proxies which is also a bit pricy... anyone offering botting services for cheap is scamming. This is the only legit way of doing it. Very expensive thats why some people charge so much. 
The people that can bot 5k viewers have the hardware to do so. I do not so cannot further go into testing it. However its working and gets the job done. I just dont have the hardware to continue.

## üåü Overview

The **Twitch Viewer Bot - Premium Edition** is a powerful Python application with a modern graphical user interface (GUI) built using PyQt6. It leverages Selenium WebDriver and various proxy services to simulate multiple viewers on a specified Twitch channel. This tool is designed for educational purposes and for content creators who wish to test their stream's performance under different viewer loads.

**Disclaimer:** This tool interacts with Twitch.tv through third-party proxy services. Use it responsibly and be aware of Twitch's Terms of Service. Misuse may lead to account suspension or other penalties. The author is not responsible for any consequences arising from the misuse of this software.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Multi-Viewer Simulation:** Simulate multiple concurrent viewers on a Twitch channel.

* **Proxy Integration:** Routes traffic through various popular proxy services (CroxyProxy, Blockaway, YoutubeUnblocked) to enhance anonymity and bypass potential geo-restrictions.

* **Headless Mode:** Run browser instances in the background without opening visible windows, conserving system resources.

* **Human-like Activity Simulation:** Includes features like random scrolling, mouse movements, and occasional video quality changes to make viewer behavior appear more natural.

* **Stealth Mode (Stable):** Prioritizes stable, human-like activity for longer viewing sessions.

* **Rapid Mode (Faster):** Focuses on faster viewer initialization for quick viewer boosts (less emphasis on human-like activity).

* **Modern GUI:** Intuitive and aesthetically pleasing dark-themed interface built with PyQt6.

* **Real-time Progress & Logging:** Monitor the status of each viewer instance and view detailed activity logs directly within the application.

* **Cross-Platform (Python):** Designed to run on any operating system that supports Python, PyQt6, and Firefox.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* **Python 3.8 or higher:**

    * [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* **Firefox Browser:**

    * [Download Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/)

* **pip (Python package installer):** Usually comes with Python.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/twitch-viewer-bot.git](https://github.com/your-username/twitch-viewer-bot.git)
    cd twitch-viewer-bot
    ```

    *(Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username or the repository owner's username if you're forking.)*

2.  **Install Python Dependencies:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Install required packages
    pip install PyQt6 selenium requests webdriver-manager
    ```

    * `PyQt6`: For the graphical user interface.

    * `selenium`: To automate browser interactions.

    * `requests`: For HTTP requests (though primarily used by `webdriver-manager`).

    * `webdriver-manager`: Automatically downloads and manages `geckodriver` (for Firefox).

## üí° Usage

1.  **Activate your virtual environment (if not already active):**

    ```
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Run the application:**

    ```
    python main.py
    ```

    *(Assuming your script is saved as `main.py`)*

3.  **Using the GUI:**

    * **Channel Name:** Enter the Twitch channel name you want to send viewers to (e.g., `your_twitch_channel`).

    * **Number of Viewers:** Select the desired number of simulated viewers (1-50). *Note: Running too many viewers may consume significant system resources and could lead to instability.*

    * **Proxy Server:** Choose a proxy server from the dropdown list. CroxyProxy is recommended for its reliability.

    * **Launch Mode:**

        * **Stealth Mode (stable):** Recommended for longer, more natural-looking viewing sessions.

        * **Rapid Mode (faster):** For quickly increasing viewer count, with less emphasis on human-like activity.

    * **Run in Headless Mode:** Check this box to run Firefox instances without visible browser windows. This is highly recommended to save system resources.

    * **Start Viewers Button:** Click to begin the viewer simulation.

    * **Stop Viewers Button:** Click to stop all active viewer instances.

    * **Activity Log:** Monitors the progress and any errors encountered during the operation.

## üåê Proxy Information

This bot utilizes web proxies to route browser traffic. This helps in distributing the origin of viewer requests and can be crucial for simulating viewers from different locations or for bypassing certain network restrictions. The supported proxies are:

* `CroxyProxy.com` (Recommended)

* `CroxyProxy.rocks`

* `Croxy.network`

* `Croxy.org`

* `CroxyProxy.net`

* `Blockaway.net`

* `YoutubeUnblocked.live`

These proxies act as intermediaries, allowing the Selenium-controlled browsers to access Twitch without directly revealing your IP address for each viewer instance.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes & Troubleshooting

* **Firefox and GeckoDriver:** This script specifically uses Firefox and `geckodriver`. Ensure Firefox is installed and up-to-date. `webdriver-manager` will automatically download the correct `geckodriver` version.

* **Resource Usage:** Running many browser instances (especially in non-headless mode) can consume significant CPU and RAM. It is strongly recommended to use **Headless Mode** for optimal performance and resource management.

* **"Controlled Folder Access" (Windows Defender):** If you encounter errors related to `geckodriver` or Firefox not launching, especially on Windows, check your Windows Defender settings. "Controlled folder access" can sometimes block Python or `geckodriver` from writing necessary files. You may need to add an exclusion for your project folder or Python executable.

* **Twitch Detection:** While efforts are made to simulate human-like activity, advanced platforms like Twitch have sophisticated bot detection systems. There's always a risk that automated viewing might be detected and not counted, or could lead to temporary/permanent bans. Use at your own discretion.

* **Proxy Reliability:** The reliability and speed of public proxy servers can vary. If you experience issues, try switching to a different proxy from the dropdown list.

* **Error Messages:** Pay attention to the "Activity Log" and any pop-up "Critical Error" messages for troubleshooting hints.
